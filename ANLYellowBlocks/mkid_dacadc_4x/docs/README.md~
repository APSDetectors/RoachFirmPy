This pcore was created by starting a new ISE project with one .v file.
The file is the pcore verilog file for the dac mkid 4x interface.
The design is based on a design from Santa Barbara, but is updated
to run on a V6 chip, using MMCM rather than DCM.
Tp assure the design will work, it can be synthesized, but not fully
built into a bit file, as no consraints are present. To get the correct 
settings for MMCM, the wizard can be used (Project->New source->Core Gen
IP->clock wizard)
Alternatively, the MMCM template can be fetched from 
Edit->language templates->verilog

By synthesizing, all syntax errors can be found, and an RTL schematic
can be generated.
This was done in ISE 14.6

The .ods file is an open office (libre office, start in linux with
soffice), of the pinouts. I checked that the dac nets on the FPGA design
matched proper FPGA pins, ZDOK pins on the Roach 2 board, and ZDOK pins
on the DAC board.

The only source code that is needed is dac_mkid_4x_interface.v




To install:
In this dir,  
mlib_dev/xps_base/XPS_ROACH2_base/pcore

cp -r
GitRepo/RoachFirmPy/ANLYellowBlocks/mkid_dac_4x/pcores/dac_mkid_4x_interface_v2_00_a \
mlib_dev/xps_base/XPS_ROACH2_base/pcores/.




In the mlib_dev/xps_library

cp GitRepo/RoachFirmPy/ANLYellowBlocks/mkid_dac_4x/xps_library/adc_mkid_4x_r2_mask.m \
mlib_devel/xps_library/.

cp -r GitRepo/RoachFirmPy/ANLYellowBlocks/mkid_dac_4x/xps_library/@xps_dac_mkid_4x_r2 \
mlib_devel/xps_library/.



To make a yellow block appear in your Simulink Library Browser, 

cp xps_library.mdl xps_librarymdl.SAVE

chmod +w xps_library.mdl


open xps_library.mdl, and unlock library.
Open in a 2nd window add_to_xps_librarymdl.mdl
Copy and paste the new block into your xps_library.mdl file. Lock the
library.

chmod -w xps_library.mdl


-----------------IMPORTANT--------------------------

THOUGH THE PINOUTS HAVE BEEN CHECKED, THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED 
ON ROACH2 HARDWARE AS OF THE TIME OF THIS COMMIT.





To install the adc block, the procedure is the same as for dac.

Included are two pdf files that are schematics of what is in the dac and adc blocks, generated from ISE. For dac, there are 2 schematics, depending on the clock selection. There should be 2 files for adc, as well, but one is included anyway.


The ods files are pinouts for each block. The block was checked against schematics. The adc block in particular needed work on the pinout. 

hwroutes.ods- map from matlab pinout table, to net name on the schematic.
dac_mkid_4x_pins.ods- pinouts for dac and adc blocks.



When building the MATLAB system know that the dac section will be called dac0, and only 
dac0 clock can be used, or sys clock. Not dac1 clock!

The adc part of the board is called adc1, so only adc1 or sys clock can be used. There is
no adc0 clock. These numbers (dac0, adc1) are based on the fact that the dac is on ZDOK0 connector, and adc is on ZDOK1.
