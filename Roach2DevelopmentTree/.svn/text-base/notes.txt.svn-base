ResData tabl


make a plot that rememvers the zoom and offset factor

plotRes button should plot ALL checked res or selected 

Need to UNSEL:ECT the res on resdata tab



Autosave the resdata file, fits etc...

add noise traces or replace noise traces? how many to add? can we have longer
traces?Can there be  a flag for pulse data?

need iq velocity plot

can we have FFT readout data based on iq vel freq? and not just fits or rough
freq?


implement that fft power spectrum of noise and make plots like nino at al. see
the emil from nino


multiplot for iq curcle noise cloud. reading out sev. resonators at once and
plotting all the iq circles in real time.


add a files tab?
have ways to step through all the dump file waveforms
ways to steo through all the resonatlrs stored...

Add a way top add notes on the gui, that is added to the res and dump files.



Add uncheck all button- DONE

Need dialog to pick files for hdf.

Add check all button- DONE

rememver check settings- DONE

need to rewrite over hdf files, - DONE, 

pick servers for multiproc.

Have to hit IF board controls after loading new FW.
make so it is set correctly

hittin if board switches when fft is running makes crashes... then we cannot run ffts, as thread stops...


reaind all bins out is only 1/2 of bins. wierd stuff in plots.///
also we have applyDelay error when we have more than ONE tone, and readout out all freqs.
ffts

Nice to plot fft in correct way, all bins... and rf in middle...


the dump file is invalid if we swtich from fft to sweep FW. or vice versa

need a separate dump file for ffts?

clear dmp file on thescreen?

some bettter way of tracking the iq index when we reload fw, the iqindex gets reset.

global var for counting sweeps in gui? 

iq_index for reading out files?

iq index is useless unless we have lawrge datasets for all sweeps- only for old stype dump files.
now we want to get ruid of it or it is only for reading out dump files.

make iq index when reading new stype dunp file be an index into the keys(). in this way we can not worry about plot number.




different code for doing dump file for netanaluzer and fft analuyzer. need to move the code from fft to netanaluzer as a
super class code.


no awy to set FFT sync time from gui



make hdf dump file work for FFT analyuzer.--- DONE

make multiproc work properly, so queue gets set up at right time, DONE
and other proc can connect... DONE


fix bug in fft sweeps:
if we sweep many mkids at once, the nosie curcle gets messed up...
some butg.
if we sweep one at a time, it works...but not all the time. 1st resonator is always bad?


Better plotting buttons....on RESdata ...

Rememver the +/- settings on the res list.

bug in del resonator code... not deleted everywhere...

nelete traces from res.


plot of iq velocity
readout based on iqvel


set num of noise traces to take.



add/delete noise trace

num of noise traces....

pulse traces needed

make hdf file save often as we take sweeps fits... overwrites hdf and saves
backup files.


Need puse server... C prog to read foga ram running on roach ppc. it buffers and
sends tcp or udp data to linux box.


phase time delay calc problems- we do calc of time delay- then we take sweeps and the phases are all wrong.


phase correct on res sweep data? lin reg on phase, then add the slop to it.Tried
this...DONE



FFT measure the tiem delay
source 100 tones
take raw IQ and search for proper delays to min. the phase change...
DONE


Make FFT tab useful... it should be the data gathering tab
pulse data file selection DONE
select channels to read. DONE
select thresholds etc.
select all vs pulse event data.
should uave useful default gatin
PLots for apply circle fit and IvQ plots.///


Need a plot of noise vers time, where we transrot the IQ data

No way to stop the sweeping w/ fft FW- this is power sweep- keeps going for ever


netanalyzer- use CORDIC block instead...

debug tab
read dump file
write dump file
set iqindex
check to read from dump file instead of roach
plots of raw data etc.. I raw, several plots Iraw, q raw, report of fa obhect...


fix dump files so we find the 1st. last sweep number then set iq index to start when we open it




Some way of finding and storing pulses  in noise data



fits- in NON multiproc- plots come up wierd... 

dump file- cannot read in data stored by fft analyzer. butgs...


On all sweeps- there is a replot befire sweep is done. why?
Alsothere is some wierd 1st plot... bad plot


Check Res Fc not work on FFT plots


Hopw to know FPGA state?
there is code, but need a debugging tab


soem problem on roach ssh to 


make sweep tab useful - so the netanalyzer code works w/ ffts- so phse and amp
not messed up.repeatable reloading of FW.
FFT tab shoudl read pulses from mkids defined ina file.

make use of IQ velocity.use that freq for center freq.


need to be able t have longer DRAM waveforms- need a control for it... 
def laneth longer...



what is fftanalyzere.py?






resbbb is a fit of all 5 res. do not know of dump file...



resonator 1, do sweep.
resdump_10...
resbbb_2

resdump 11- we do all resonators, 
resbbb_3.h5 will be the fits of these res...
